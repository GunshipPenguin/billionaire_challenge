# The Billionaire's Challenge

Multibillionare Mike Moneybags has just died, leaving an estate valued at
$54.3 billion USD. In his will, he left his entire estate to the first person
who can solve a series of technical challenges.

This is where you come in Hacker. As a keen technology enthusiast, you're up
to the challenge, and are itching to begin (Also, having your own Swiss
villa sounds pretty nice).

Before we go any further, some rules and information:
- The game is divided into a series of clues, with each clue having a particular
  random string key associated with it (Eg.
  `7d97e98f8af710c7e7fe703abc8f639e0ee507c4`). To access a clue, append its key to
  the base URL (Eg. http://localhost:5000/7d97e98f8af710c7e7fe703abc8f639e0ee507c4),
- Each clue will lead you to the key for the next clue, keep going until you
  reach the end
- The clues will get progressively more and more difficult
- No looking at any of the Python source during the game
- You may use any web browser or Curl to retrieve information from a URL
- If using a web browser, you will have to use your browser's developer tools
- If you're stuck, the clue you're on may have a hint (or more than one). You
  can append `/hint/hint_num` to the clue's URL to view the hint with the
  specified hint number.
  (Eg. http://localhost:5000/7d97e98f8af710c7e7fe703abc8f639e0ee507c4/hint/1)
  to view the first hint.

Ready to begin? Ensure that you have Flask installed and run.
